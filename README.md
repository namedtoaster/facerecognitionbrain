Before running this project, be sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory
Then add the following line:
```
REACT_APP_CLARIFAI_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```
and replace `YOUR_KEY` with your Clarifai API key

Once that's complete, install the dependencies by running `npm install`. Then run the app by calling `npm start`. Assuming you're running with the backend (see https://github.com/namedtoaster/faceapp), be sure to start that first and make sure this is running on port 3001.
